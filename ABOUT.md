# About MOC Studio

## Overview

**MOC Studio** is an enterprise-grade Management of Change (MOC) ecosystem specifically designed for the Oil & Gas industry. It combines real-time operational telemetry, advanced risk analysis, and AI-powered technical support to streamline change management processes in offshore and onshore facilities.

---

## What is Management of Change (MOC)?

Management of Change is a critical process in the Oil & Gas industry that ensures all modifications to equipment, procedures, materials, or operating conditions are:
- **Properly reviewed** for safety and operational impacts
- **Thoroughly documented** with complete audit trails
- **Risk-assessed** before implementation
- **Approved** by authorized personnel
- **Communicated** to all affected stakeholders

MOC Studio digitizes and automates this essential safety management system, reducing risk and improving operational efficiency.
